# Part 2: Another shocker (like day 5)

Each path must enter a cycle (because finitely many states). So we know from some point onwards that all N ghosts are repeating themselves. If we enter this fully cyclical state before finding a solution, then we may be able to work out the answer without continuing.

For example, if every cycle has only one "Z" state in it, then you solve N modular arithmetic equations.
